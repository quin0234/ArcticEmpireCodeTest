Group Chat Application, with User, Message and Room on Loopback. 

Application doesn't work, issues below. I have had some issues with NPM and Sudo whilst installing packages need to complete this task. Tried to change my global packages folder which created a bug where I had to use the source ~/.bash_profile command everytime I closed and reopen the terminal. This is shown in the video.
